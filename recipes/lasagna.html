    <h3>How to make Lasagna step-by-step</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all your ingredients.
      </li>

      <li>
        Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.
      </li>

      <li>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
      </li>

      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
      </li>

      <li>
        To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
      </li>

      <li>
        Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Rest lasagna for 20 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
